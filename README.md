> A customizable, composable component library focused on Developer Experience 💻

ComposeUI was created with one goal in mind: to enable developers to customize their User Interface (UI) without worrying about the underlying logic 🎨

Popular libraries like Ant Design, Material-UI, and Bootstrap are great for speeding up development but often make it difficult to customize components 🔧

Our primary focus is on providing an excellent Developer Experience (DX), ensuring developers are productive, creative, and happy 😃

ComposeUI concentrates on truly composable and customizable components, making it easy to tailor both the UI and component logic 🔀
